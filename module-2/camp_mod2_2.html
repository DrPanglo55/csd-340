            <p><span class="sentence">The first stop on my adventure brought me to Montana. It was unusually cold for late spring
                as I arrived at the Lolo hotsprings. I went to watch some live music, but was tired from travling and decided to leave early.
            </span>I awoke the next morning ready well rested and ready tto continue my journey. I found a piece of cardboard and wrote the word
            west in large block letters and stood at the campsites exit trying to get a ride from the people leaving the festival.</p>
            <p>I was was offered a ride from a group of people who were food venders at the festival. If I helped them take down their booth
                and pack their trailer they would give me a ride as far as Olympia Washington.
            </p>
            <p>I stayed the night at their house. They offered to let me stay for longer but I was eager to get to Seattle
                and meet up with Duffy. I ate breakfast and found my way to the bus depot and spent the last of my money on a ticket to seattle.
